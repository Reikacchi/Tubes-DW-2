                    <p><b>Resonator</b> are obtainable characters in <b>Wuthering Waves</b>. Individuals with the ability to resonate with certain objects and manipulate their frequencies are known as Resonators.</p>
                    <p>Each Resonator has a <b>Forte Examination Report</b> that evaluates their status as a Resonator. These individuals exhibit a Resonance Ability, also known as a <b>Forte</b> through a symbol, known as the <b>Tacet Mark</b>, on their bodies, and they may have unique <b>Resonance Spectrum Patterns</b> that determine their abilities and relates to their <b>Attributes</b>. They are classified by their <b>Rabelle's Curve</b> into one of the following: <b>Natural</b>, <b>Mutant</b>, <b>Congenital</b>, or <b>Artificial</b>. According to experts, a Resonator's abilities are often influenced by their past experiences and subconscious mind.</p>
                    <p>Exerting one's mental capacity and an exhausted emotional state can lead to Overclocking; losing control of one's Forte. Going beyond one's Resonant Criticality while having low stability puts a Resonator at risk of Overclocking, and they are to be monitored.</p>
                    <p>Resonators carry a <b>Pangu Terminal</b>, which is a gourd-shaped terminal that is a symbol of a Resonator's identity.</p>
